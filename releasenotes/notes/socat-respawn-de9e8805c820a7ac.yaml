fixes:
  - Ironic does not monitor the socat proxy started for serial console
    access. The socat process would exit on client disconnect, which
    would (a) leave a zombie socat process in the process table and (b)
    disable any subsequent serial console connections. Fixed the issue by
    updating Ironic to call socat with the ``fork,max-children=1`` options,
    which makes socat persist and accept multiple connections (but only one
    at a time).  See https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2005024.
